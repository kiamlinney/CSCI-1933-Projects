How to compile and run the program:
- To compile: type "javac FractalDrawer.java"
- To run: type "java FractalDrawer"
- The program will then prompt for input on which shape to make the fractal out of, select 1 for circle, 2 for triangle, or 3 for rectangle
- Just follow the onscreen instructions
- That's it!

Assumptions:
- Assuming that the user will enter either 1, 2, or 3. If anything else, an error message will appear

Additional Features:
- I implemented the ability to have complete random colors in the fractals
- But I decided against having each iteration have a different random color, because it looks too chaotic
- Instead, each time a fractal is generated, it will be a new completely random color
- And after each iteration, instead of being a new random color, will be the same color but a lighter shade
- I implemented bright rainbow pastel colors for the random colors, so no dull boring colors will be generated

Bugs/Glitches:
- Initially, the fractal does not load completely, in order to make it load, full screen the window

Outside sources:
- I got the idea for implementing bright rainbow pastel colors from stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8739276
- I got the formula for an equilateral triangle from its width from: https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/height-of-equilateral-triangle/

I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and accurate.
