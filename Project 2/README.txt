How to compile and run the program:
- To compile: type "javac Game.java"
- To run: type "java Game"
- If using an IDE, just press run
- Follow the on-screen instructions and follow the given format

Assumptions:
- That the user knows the basic rules of chess
- That the user follows the on-screen format correctly
- That the user does not input nonsensical values

Additional Features:
- A starting set of on-screen instructions
- The implementation of resignation, if at any point the user wants to resign,
  just like they would be able to in a real chess game. They can do so by inputting "r" or "R"

Bugs/Glitches:
- If using dark mode, the white chess pieces will appear black and the black chess pieces will appear white
- The black pawn can occasionally print as an emoji
- Occasionally after inputting a move, it freezes like it's loading but does not end up doing anything.
  To fix this, just type something in again, and it should load
